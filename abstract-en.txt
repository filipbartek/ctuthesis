Automatic theorem proving (ATP) for first-order logic (FOL) is a technology that allows solving a wide array of formalized tasks that arise in domains such as mathematics and software verification. Saturation-based automatic theorem provers, exemplified by the highly optimized prover Vampire, constitute the state of the art in ATP.

The operation of state-of-the-art\todo{sota is repeated twice in a quick succession.} provers is guided by various heuristics.
Given an input problem,
the chance of success may vary greatly depending on the configuration of the heuristics.
Traditionally, the heuristics are configured by an expert user.
In a typical prover, the number of possible configurations is large and the response to a configuration hard to predict.
This makes machine learning (ML) an attractive alternative to relying on an expert user.

This dissertation thesis presents a line of research in ML for saturation-based ATP. I designed and evaluated three approaches of applying ML to improve the performance of the saturation-based prover Vampire. In the first approach, I created and evaluated a system that, given an arbitrary input problem, predicts a symbol precedence to instantiate a simplification ordering on terms. Secondly, I created a system that predicts symbol weights for the weighted symbol-counting clause selection scheme. Finally, my co-authors and I created a system that automatically finds complementary strategies and constructs strong strategy schedules that generalize well to unseen problems.

All the research presented in this thesis has been published in peer-reviewed papers. The thesis includes the papers in their final published form.
