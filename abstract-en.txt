Automatic theorem proving (ATP) for first-order logic (FOL) is a technology that allows solving a wide array of formalized tasks
coming from domains such as mathematics and software verification.
Saturation-based automatic theorem provers,
exemplified by the highly optimized prover Vampire,
constitute the state of the art in ATP.

State-of-the-art provers contain various heuristics that guide the proof search.
Configuring these heuristics well\todo{too informal} can greatly increase the chance of success on an arbitrary input problem.
Machine learning (ML) can substitute an expert user in configuring the heuristics.

This dissertation thesis presents a line of research into ML for saturation-based ATP.
I experimented with three ways of applying ML to improve the performance of the saturation-based prover Vampire.
In the first set of experiments, I created and evaluated a system that, given an arbitrary input problem, predicts a symbol precedence to instantiate a simplification ordering on terms.
Secondly, I created a system that predicts symbol weights for the weighted symbol-counting clause selection scheme.
Finally, I constructed strong strategy schedules.

All the research presented in this thesis has been published in peer-reviewed papers.
The thesis includes the papers in their final published form.
