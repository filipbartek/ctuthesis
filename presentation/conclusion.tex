\begin{frame}[<+->]{Main achievements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Training a precedence and symbol weight recommender
\begin{itemize}
\item Proxy task: Ranking of precedences or clauses
\item Precedence recommender: +\pc{4.8} problems solved
\item Symbol weight recommender: +\pc{6.5620542} problems solved
\end{itemize}
%\item Signature-agnostic lossless R-GCN for CNF problems
\item Strategy schedule construction
\begin{itemize}
\item Greedy schedule is a pragmatic alternative to perfect optimization
\begin{itemize}
\item Much faster schedule construction (feasible for large datasets)
\item Nearly the same performance on unseen problems
\end{itemize}
\item Regularization (sacrifice train performance to gain test performance)
\begin{itemize}
\item Applicable to budgeted algorithm scheduling in general
\item Temporal reward adjustment regularizes well
\end{itemize}
\item Contributed to the success of Vampire at CASC-J12 (victory in 6 out of 7 divisions)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
